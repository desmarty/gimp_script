<b>Export Layers</b> - A script to export each layer to file as .jpg or .png format
    <br>i. Just Paste the script into script folder (find the script folders in gimp->preferences->folders and paste just the file or the whole export_layers folder)
    <br>ii. Goto: Filters/Script-fu/Refresh scripts or just restart Gimp
    <br>iii. You can find the Export Layers option in file menu
    <br>iv. Rest of the steps can be done by any normal human being :)
    <br>v. The names of exported files will be same as that of the layers
    <br><b>Note:</b> dot (.) as a layer name should be avoided.
